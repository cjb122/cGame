## Our Game
The year is 2025, a coalition of Earths great powers have come together to fund Man's furthest exploration into space to date.  It is believed that on the distant Galilean moon Europa, orbiting Jupiter, there may be liquid water underneath the dense frozen surface.  Earth scientists are eager to find out if there may be any bacterium or any signs of life in this liquid water.  Your mission is to take the 8 month journey to Europa, safely land on the planets surface, search for any evidence of life and safely return to report any of your findings.  If this mission is successful, Earth may fund another mission several years from now, but if you don't find anything or fail to return to report your findings, if may be the end of this exploratory endeavor.  

After landing, you discover much more than bacteria.  You and your crew came equiped to take small ice samples and explore an open planet. You discover the remnants of an alien base on a battle field that took place between two alien races.  The freezing temperatures of Europa has left the battlefield almost perfectly preserved in ice and everything you find is a new discovery for mankind.  Your mission has taken on a whole new life.  Now there is technology to be found, bases and crashed ships to explore, and aliens to understand.  But why were these races fighting?  How was so much damage done?  And are the aliens that did this still here?...  


Should state the goals for this game for the term (i.e., what criteria must be met for the term project to be complete)
Our goals for this game are to develop an adventure game that randomly generates new areas for a player to explore every time they play the game.  We intend to develop enemies that behave intelligently based on their strength and the strength of the players, so the enemies are not suicidal. 


### Advanced Topics
For our advanced featues, we will explore the topics of Advanced AI, advanced physics and procedurally generated maps.  We will use advanced AI to to make enemies behave with different levels of intelligence and strategy.  Using advanced physics, we will simulate heat distribution and exploye the effects of different levels of atmospheric pressure.  Finally, we will develop a procedure for randomly generating areas to explore to reenfore the exploration aspect of our game.  


Should list which students are working on each advanced topic subteam
##### Team Leader 
- Justin Budd
- Brad Munson (Assistant to the Regional Manager)

##### Advanced AI
- Ness Colihan (Group Lead)

Should describe what organizational approaches the team will take over the term, e.g.:
##### Will Slack or equivalent be used for project discussion?
- Yes we have already set-up a slack.

##### What development methodologies will be used (if any)?
- Basing our developement methodolies on that of Agile. We will have multiple leadership roles to allow for easy communication.

##### What coding style will be followed?
- Commenting before each method with any applicable params.
- Commenting each end bracket of a method with the mehthod name for clarity.
